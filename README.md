#Time Trace of Photoswitchable Fluorophore
Superresolution microscopy such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy **_(STORM)_** and Photoactivated Localication Microscopy **_(PALM)_** heavily depends on the performance of photoswitchable or photoactivatable fluorophores. Analysis of the performance, or say, benchmark the properties of photoswitchable or photoactivatable fluorophores is of high importance. One of the most important properties is the on-off duty cycle.

The project provides matlab scripts that analyze the on-off duty cycle on a single fluorophore.
